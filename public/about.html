<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Ayy, I remember syrup sandwiches and crime allowances <br/>
  Finesse on 'em with some counterfeits, but now I'm countin' this <br/>
  Parmesan where my accountant lives, in fact, I'm downin' this <br/>
  D'USSÃ‰ with my boo bae tastes like Kool-Aid for the analysts <br/>
  Girl, I can buy yo' ass the world with my paystub <br/>
  I know that it's good, won't you sit it on my taste bluds? <br/>
  I get way too petty once you let me do the extras <br/>
  Pull up on your block, then break it down, we playin' Tetris <br/>
  A.m. to the p.m., p.m. to the a.m., funk <br/>
  Eat up your per diem, you just gotta hate 'em, funk <br/>
  If I quit your BM, I still ride Mercedes, funk <br/>
  If I quit this season, I still be the greatest, funk</p>
